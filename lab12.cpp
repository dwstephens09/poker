/*
 * Course: CS216-00x
 * Project: Lab 12 (as part of Project 3)
 * Purpose: it demonstrates sorting operations on different data items in different sorting criteria by using template class
 *          the program repeatedly asks the user to choose an option from the main menu
 *          1. Sort five-card in hand in ascending and descending order by card points (as in poker game)
 *          2. Sort prefix-matched terms in lexicographic order by query and in descending order by weight (as in autocomplete feature)
 * Author: Dennis Stephens
 *     Lab12 code written by Yi Pike
